## Simple Social Network in Laravel
---
**Postworm** (I seem to have a knack to give funny names) is a web platform where users can create posts and view other people's posts.

It was actually created when I first started learning laravel. I figured I'd redo an old project in laravel to get up to speed with it. I made a similar app - [Postr](https://github.com/kingdageek/postr) - in a basic MVC framework I created - [rivrbankMVC](https://github.com/kingdageek/rivrbankMVC) and decided to recreate it in Laravel. 

So, *clone the repo*, run `composer install` to get the neccessary packages, copy *.env.example* to your *.env* and enter your app and environment specific details, then run `php artisan migrate` to get the migrations.
